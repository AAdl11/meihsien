# Tzu Chi Bay Area Journey of Goodness (慈濟灣區善行之旅)
[English] | [繁體中文](./README.zh-Hant.md)

## About The Project
Open-source interactive ecosystem app promoting Tzu Chi San Francisco's compassionate contributions via AI, gamification, and emotional literacy. Like Elon Musk's integrated empires, this one-stop hub fuses four stations: Sunset Clubhouse (spiritual re-growth), Humanities School (moral education, Chinese teaching + four dimensions eight virtues), Morning Light Station (elegant action), and Hunter's Point (happy community action, long-term cultivation of Chinatown scattered housing care and Liu Guiming Elementary food distribution). Hunter's Point, as San Francisco's forgotten corner, was once a Chinese shrimp fishing community (evicted in the 1930s for WWII military use), becoming a Black community post-war, facing poverty, unemployment, pollution, and environmental challenges (unemployment rate at 19%, far above San Francisco's average). Tzu Chi has been deeply involved since 2004, providing food distribution, educational counseling, and community care, illuminating this area in need of companionship. Users accumulate shared heart energy across modalities, unlocking rewards, discovering Tzu Chi's warmth, depth, and action—cultivating gratitude, participation, and co-cultivating global blessings. Invite contributors to iterate quickly, advance through failure, and build eternal impact!
