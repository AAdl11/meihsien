# 🌉 Journey of Kindness — Tzu Chi San Francisco

> 「慈濟之路 - 舊金山慈濟。真正的帝國不在土地，而在心靈的共鳴。」
> *The true empire is not of land, but of hearts in resonance.*

從舊金山出發，融合慈濟的善行精神、遊戲化設計與 AI 技術，我們打造一個讓新世代透過遊戲參與慈善、建立文化共鳴的數位平台。這源自我（Mei Hsien Hsu）的情感之旅：從晨光儀式與心情園圃擴展而出，旨在傳遞永恆善意，透過平台招募共創者並分享故事——包括我腎臟移植的轉化經歷，成為陪伴腎友的慈悲力量。

From San Francisco, blending Tzu Chi's compassionate spirit, gamification design, and AI technology, we create a digital platform for the new generation to participate in charity through games and build cultural resonance. This stems from my (Mei Hsien Hsu's) emotional journey: expanding from morning rituals and mood garden, aiming to spread enduring kindness, recruiting co-creators through the platform and sharing stories—including my kidney transplant transformation, becoming a compassionate support for kidney friends.

## 🌱 Hi, I'm Mei Hsien Hsu — Designing Tools with Soul
As a Honors Transfer Program student at Las Positas College and dedicated Tzu Chi volunteer, I blend emotional literacy, AI, and science education to create meaningful, bilingual tools that support mental clarity and self-awareness. My journey began with a kidney transplant, turning pain into purpose: every two months, I lead Tzu Chi Northern California's kidney support group, sharing stories of resilience to uplift patients and families. This goodwill thread weaves through my work, reminding us that technology isn't just code—it's a vessel for compassion. This repo reflects my life's mission: making technology feel human-rooted in stories, soul, and goodwill, extending narratives through collaborative platforms.

### What I'm Building App: An interactive journey promoting Tzu Chi's contributions through AI-gamified modules, where personal stories like mine inspire engagement.
- **🌅 CompassionAI App**: An interactive journey promoting Tzu Chi's contributions through AI-gamified modules, where personal stories like mine inspire engagement.
- **🌱 Mood Garden Integration**: Symbolic emotion plants guiding tasks and meditation, now fused with Tzu Chi themes.
- **📚 Open-Source Ecosystem**: Tools to teach, inspire, and grow with the community, focusing on recruitment and story sharing.

## 🧩 Cultural & Ethical Roots — Tzu Chi Bay Area Journey of Goodness
本專案源自 **美國慈濟舊金山分會** 的「Journey of Goodness」願景，以數位互動與遊戲化任務，將慈濟的精神轉化為新世代可參與、可傳播的形式。強調陪伴而非幫助，培育感恩與永續，延伸個人故事——如我的移植經歷，轉化痛苦為力量，邀請你加入這份心靈共鳴。

This project stems from the **Journey of Goodness** by Tzu Chi San Francisco Branch's "Journey of Goodness" mission, using digital media to intersect with real-world interactions and gamified tasks to transform Tzu Chi's spirit into a form that the new generation can relate to and spread. Emphasizing companionship over help, nurturing gratitude and sustainability, extending personal stories—like my transplant experience, transforming pain into strength, inviting you to join this heart resonance in speed.

## 🎮 Design Philosophy | 設計哲學
- **Rapid Iteration**: Quick prototyping, testing, and optimization to build a minimum viable product (MVP) in about a week.
- **Branching Strategy Design**: Choices in the app affect subsequent tasks and interactions with the community.
- **Cultural Integration**: Games serve as bridges for sharing culture and spirituality, with AI helping to enhance the user experience.
- **Life Experience Fusion**: Incorporating my personal experiences (from kidney transplant challenges to community involvement) to recruit collaborators and help users feel the impact of transformation.
 
- **快速疊代**：快速原型、測試、優化——7天MVP，證明執行力。
- **策略設計**：每個選擇影響後續任務與社群互動。
- **高維度文化格局**：遊戲是文化與靈性的橋樑，AI是放大善意的工具，融合我的生命經歷（從腎臟移植的感情牽動，到社區行動），延伸故事並招募夥伴，讓每位玩家感受到轉化的力量。

## Current Progress (As of October 06, 2025)
The prototype is in early development, aligned with the semester timeline for completion by December 9, 2025. Key achievements:
- Completed initial literature review (10 sources on AI ethics, HCI, and gamification for social good—see references below).
- Designed technical architecture: User's journey modeled as a Search Problem with Informed Search; Propositional Logic for Knowledge Base of Jing Si Aphorisms; MDP for decision-making under uncertainty.
- Created home page mockup in Canva Pro (integrated bilingual elements, Tzu Chi logo, "How are you today?" prompt, start button—see mockup section above).
- Generated Hunters Point map placeholder in Fooocus (cartoon grid with paths for Stage 3 probabilistic reasoning, symbolizing aid transformation—see map above).
- Started index.html: Stage 1 (Inner Exploration) functional with user input for feelings, logic rules for aphorism display. Example code snippet (Propositional Logic simulation for rational agent reasoning):
  ```javascript:disable-run
  const knowledgeBase = {
    stressed: "Deep breath release stress. Calm your mind, and clarity will follow.",
    grateful: "Gratitude opens the door to abundance. Cherish what you have.",
    default: "Witness the moment without judgment. Carry this peace forward."
  };
  function reflect() {
    const input = document.getElementById('userInput').value.toLowerCase().trim();
    let aphorism = knowledgeBase.default;
    if (input.includes('stress')) aphorism = knowledgeBase.stressed;
    else if (input.includes('grate')) aphorism = knowledgeBase.grateful;
    document.getElementById('output').innerText = `Jing Si Aphorism: ${aphorism}`;
  }
  ```
- Ethical considerations: Addressing AI bias in aphorism selection via diverse entries.
- Next steps: Complete Stage 1 by October 21; integrate full AI logic by end of semester for GitHub Pages deployment.

This progress ensures the game lands as a functional proof-of-concept by semester end, with full deliverables: Deployed prototype and 12-page APA research paper (draft in progress, including code explanations and ethical discussions).
